;; My implementation of integer division
;; Could probably be done way more efficiently as i used murpp
;; io0 & io1 are inputs
;; s4 is remainder, result in io0
;; This is NOT the version for murpp's `div`, this doesn't calculate x/x correctly and the output register are different in the final

movz s3
start:
    cpy s1 io0
    cpy s2 io1
    cmp s1 s2
    case s4 end,iter,end

    inc s3
