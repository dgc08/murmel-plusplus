;; HOW TO USE
;; 1. Start the program. It'll stay in an infinite loop until you enter something
;; 2. io0 (which is the first register) & io1 take the input
;; 3. If you are done, set io2 to 1. This will start the calculation and put io4 as a kind of "status LED" to 1
;; 4. Wait until io4 is 0 again. You will find the output in io3. You can continue to use the program without restarting

start:
    mov e0 #6
    mov e1 #8
    sub e0 e1
